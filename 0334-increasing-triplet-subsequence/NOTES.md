CODE:
`class Solution {
public boolean increasingTriplet(int[] nums) {
int smallest=Integer.MAX_VALUE;
int small=Integer.MAX_VALUE;
for(int n:nums)
{
if(n<=smallest)
smallest=n;
else if(n<=small)
small=n;
else
return true;
}
return false;
}
}`
SOLUTION LOGIC :
* RUN A LOOP FROM IN INCRFESSING ORDER OF INDICES
* DEFINE A VARIABLE SMALLEST
* DEFINE A VARIABLE SMALL
* SMALLEST WILL HAVE THE SMALLEST VALUE
* SMALL WILL HAVE A VALUE SUCH THAT IT IS BIGGER THAN SMALL BUT IS JUST BIGGER THAN SMALL RAHTER IT IS THE NEXT SMALLEST NO
* NOTE THAT SMALL IS NOT THE LARGEST NO
* THE LOGIC IS THAT IF WE EVER FIND A NO WHICH CANNOT BE SMALLEST OR IT CAN BE SMALL , IT HAS TO BE LARGER THAN BOTH AND AUTOMATICALLY COMMING LATER IN THE LOOP.
* WHENEVER SUCH A CONDITION OCCURS WE NEED TO RETURN TRUE.
* ELSE RETURN FALSE
